Nostalgic tasks from my bachelor degree in mechatronics at AGH in Cracow.

Mostly easy projects, simple tasks from lab classes in:
  * Computer vision
  * Optimalization
  * Construction of machines
  * Classifications
  * Signal processing

All codes done in MATLAB. Drawings are done in Inventor. And all is in Polish.
